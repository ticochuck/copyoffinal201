# **weekly-planner**

Welcome to Team's DOMit Final Project. We created an app called weekly-planner. This app will serve as place for users to keep track of daily events. 

## **Vision**
*To provide users with a place where they can plan out daily events for a seven day period*

## **Minimum MVP definition**
We have a calendar page where users can add an event from a drop down and that event to the selected day of the week. This will be displayed on the selected day.

## **User Stories** 
User Stories are listed in our Trello board:
